It would analyze the problem based on the given question and numbers, then identify relevant mathematical rules or formulas using key facts. Instead of simply providing an answer, the calculator would explain the reasoning and general approach behind the solution. This way, students can better understand why certain steps are taken rather than just following them. The tool could adapt to different types of problems, from basic arithmetic to more complex applications. It would serve as both a calculator and a learning assistant. The goal is to make problem-solving more intuitive and educational, helping students build long-term understanding of mathematical concepts.", "treatment": 1, "id": "osm3w"}, {"index": "c1_609", "text": "Brainstorming ideas: annoyance picking colours while coding: colour converter to different forms: hex codes etc. quick emoticons for user input words.", "treatment": 1, "id": "esh4h"}, {"index": "c1_611", "text": "I‘m planning to do a website, where people from all over the world can talk to each other about different problems, no matter what language they‘re speaking.

This would involve developing web-scraping tools or utilizing APIs from news aggregators to ensure a comprehensive collection. Each article would then be analyzed for key themes, facts, and opinions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to maintain neutrality.\n\nThe next step would be to design an algorithm that identifies and compares the viewpoints presented in the different articles, labeling any potential biases. Summarization techniques, such as extractive and abstractive summarization, would be employed to compile an unbiased overview of the story from multiple perspectives. The user interface would need to clearly present the sources and the summarized information, allowing users to access the original articles for further reading.

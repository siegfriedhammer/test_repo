Objective: Players set goals for screen time limits and specific tasks to accomplish, aiming to cultivate a virtual plant that thrives on productivity. 2.

Distraction Penalty: Conversely, if players exceed their set screen time limits, especially on social media, the plant wilts, visually representing the consequences of distraction. 4. Task Activation: Users can activate “nurture” mode to focus on a specific task, setting a countdown timer to enhance motivation and urgency. 5. Rewards System: Successfully completing tasks within the set time yields extra treats, such as virtual fertilizer or decorative items to further enhance the plant’s growth. 6. Progress Tracking: The app features a progress tracker that visually displays plant health alongside completed tasks, providing players with detailed feedback on their focus habits. 7. Community Engagement: Users can share their plant progress with friends or in a community setting, fostering motivation through friendly competition and encouragement. 8.

Daraufhin werden dann die Aufgaben in Aufwandsklassen sortiert. Die sortierten Aufgaben sollen dann als Alternativen vorgeschlagen werden, welche man in Momenten, wo man nur große Aufgaben mit all ihren Deadlines sieht, leichter und mit weniger Hemmung abarbeiten kann. Die App soll damit letztendlich für eine Möglichkeit sorgen, dass Menschen, welche sich im Alltag leicht ablenken lassen, eine klarere Übersicht über leichte kleine Schritte bringen, mit welchen sie ihre Vorhaben angehen können.

For instance, if 70% of runners drink water from the stations, the total would be 400 liters x 0.7 = 280 liters consumed.\n\nThis is a rough estimate, and the actual total could vary based on attendance and consumption patterns.", "treatment": 1, "id": "ame8n"}, {"index": "q2_124", "text": "several thousand liters", "treatment": 0, "id": "adt5a"}, {"index": "q2_169", "text": "In a marathon with several thousand participants, water consumption can vary significantly based on hydration strategies and weather conditions. On average, each runner might consume between 0.5 to 1 liter of water during the race. If we consider a marathon with around 10,000 participants, this could translate to roughly 5,000 to 10,000 liters of water consumed throughout the event. Additionally, aid stations typically provide extra water to accommodate varying needs, which can increase overall usage. Factors like race day temperature and humidity also play a role in how much water is needed. Overall, it's crucial for race organizers to plan accordingly to ensure hydration needs are met effectively.", "treatment": 1, "id": "afe8t"}, {"index": "q2_172", "text": "There will be used several thousand litres due to many water stations.

Assuming each runner drinks at about 5 different stations, we can calculate the initial water consumption. If each runner takes approximately 2 cups at each stop, that results in a projection of 5,000 runners × 5 stations × 2 cups = 50,000 cups of water. Converting this to liters, we have 50,000 cups × 0.5 liters/cup = 25,000 liters. However, not all runners will drink at every station, and factors such as weather and individual hydration needs come into play. A reasonable estimate indicates that about 30% of the initial water consumption could be reduced for those skipping stations. This adjustment leads to a more realistic estimation: 25,000 liters × 0.7 = 17,500 liters. To bolster the case further, referencing studies on hydration during endurance events could provide additional context, making the estimation more robust and credible for academic evaluators. Overall, while the estimates are grounded in logical reasoning, enhancing the explanation with relevant research could improve it.", "treatment": 1, "id": "tsy5b"}, {"index": "q2_345", "text": "how many people are running? how many places with water? how big are cups? 0.3*500*12*0.2 per station 30% take a cup with water, there are 500 runners and twelve stations, each cup contains 0.2 l of water.", "treatment": 1, "id": "ösa4b"}, {"index": "q2_362", "text": "Many runners drink much water.

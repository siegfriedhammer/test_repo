The most notable thing is that energy consumption in both electricity and gas goes down during the warmer months, so from April to October, and is higher during the other colder months. Looking at the visitor numbers, they depend as well on the time of year and in that same period of warmer months the numbers go up, reaching a high of 22,900 visitors in July and a low of 7,900 in March. This is probably related to needing less energy in warmer months for heating and probably shorter opening times for the less visited colder months, therefore needing less energy. Of course, visiting numbers go up in summer since that’s when people tend to want to go to the swimming pool for a refreshment.", "treatment": 0, "id": "eae5h"}, {"index": "q1_38", "text": "In 2024, the highest amount of visitors at the \"Südpool\" were during the summer, with July having over 22,000 visitors. With an increasing amount of visitors, the kiosk revenue rises as well. The energy consumption, seen by gas and electricity measurements, fell in correlation with the visitor numbers. Thus, the highest consumption of energy was in cold months, such as November through February, whilst the visitor numbers remained lower. This does not imply a causality between high visitor numbers and low energy consumption but rather indicates that during cold months, less people want to go to the pool and more energy is needed to ensure an appropriate temperature at the pool.", "treatment": 0, "id": "ion4h"}, {"index": "q1_91", "text": "A lot of people like to go swimming and some even do so over the whole year. But while the price of a visit may stay the same over the year, do costs for consumption of gas and electricity do so as well? Looking at the “Südpool” in the local region, we took a look at the changes that may apply to the consumption of energy and the costs that may come with it. Looking over the year, it became clear that in winter, the usage of gas and electricity goes way higher than in summer while the amount of people that use the swimming pool goes down.

As recent studies have shown, our local public swimming pool is under-visited and over-fueled in the winter months. As the revenue in January is less than a third of the revenue in the peak month June, and the gas consumption of the pool also almost doubles in the cold months, we wonder how this pool will hold up in the future. Will it crumble under sustainability politics or be visited in more months due to increasing temperatures?", "treatment": 0, "id": "aja7m"}, {"index": "q1_175", "text": "Swimming pools are a seasonal delight for visitors who enjoy tanning, a water fight or just relaxing on a floaty with a drink in hand. Nevertheless, one can’t deny that a dip in a cool pool requires warm temperatures. The local Südpol swimming pool is open all year round, yet its profits rise around summer. From the month of April to the end of September, the number of visitors vastly increases compared to the rest of the year. Although activity is at an all-time high here, the costs of keeping the pool running remain high all year round, especially electricity costs. Even with high costs, the demand people bring in balances these prices, in kiosks for instance. Interestingly enough, gas costs rise in the months where the pool brings in less activity. This is probable, as cold temperatures require hot pools.", "treatment": 0, "id": "eaa8l"}, {"index": "q1_177", "text": "The Südpool saw rising visitor numbers in the first half of 2024, reaching a peak in July before declining again toward winter.

But how have entry levels changed and to what environmental cost? Gas consumption on the property has naturally decreased in warmer months when heating the pool can be done with renewable sources like solar and generally isn't as needed thanks to warmer daily temperatures, but we do see a slight net increase in gas usage from January 2024 (11,200m^3) to December 2024 (11,500m^3). We see a negative correlation between gas usage and visitor numbers, where in summer months the gas usage is at its lowest (around 5-6,000m^3) and visitors peak at almost 23,000 in the month of July. What a party! Money matters. This is clearly a business that is heavily influenced by seasons; in summer months revenues are almost triple what they are in winter months - saunas, anyone? It really appears that Südpool isn't as economically viable in winter months, and neither is it very sustainable during these periods because of increased gas and electricity use and decreased visitor numbers. Scientists recommend only heating indoor pools in winter to help reduce the heat unnecessarily lost to the environment through heating of outdoor pools, in a time when there are few people in there anyway.

Dieser Anstieg kann auf neu hinzugefügte Funktionen, wie Wasserrutschen und Fitnessprogramme, die ein breiteres Publikum ansprechen, zurückgeführt werden.

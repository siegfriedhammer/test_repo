The daily customer traffic plays a critical role; for instance, a supermarket receiving about 1,000 customers daily could serve as a baseline. Furthermore, it’s essential to gauge how many bottles each customer might return; this can vary widely based on individual habits, with an estimated average around 3 bottles per customer. Multiplying the number of customers by the average bottles returned gives us a rough estimate—1,000 customers returning 3 bottles each results in approximately 3,000 bottles per day. Seasonal factors and promotions may also influence these numbers, especially during busy periods like holidays. Moreover, customer recycling habits and awareness can impact return rates significantly. If more data is available, such as historical return rates or specific customer behavior insights, it could further refine this estimate for accuracy.", "treatment": 1, "id": "rjd5h"}, {"index": "q2_308", "text": "6 bottles per person on average.

If there is a queue, I’m thinking 2-4 people per hour, averaging 2. So at most 12x12x4=576 and 12x12x3=432.

Because most times people visit, they don't bring deposit bottles and instead tend to collect them to bring them all at once for ease, I'd estimate that one out of 50 visitors brings deposit bottles, maybe around 20 bottles. So if the supermarket is opened 7-21, that is 14 hours.
